# Siteation
Site-ation is a Browser Extension and GitHub Action that uses DynamoDB to log when a site(be it a Blog Post, Stack Overflow Thread, or online guide) helped someone solve a problem in their PR!

Site-ation aims to access as little information from your Org/Repo as possible. **No information or contents about your Identity, PR, Account, or Org are accessed or stored except for any URLs that are located under a "[Site-ations]" list in your initial PR's Issue Description section**.

## Installation Instruction:
### Github App
#### 1. Go to the [Site-ation Github App](https://github.com/apps/site-ation) and add it to your user account:

### Usage:
#### Viewing Site-ations:
While navigating around the web, if a site has any site-ations, then the extension Icon will turn Green. If you land on a specific page that has been cited, the page's site-ation score will appear next to the extension icon.

#### Adding Site-ations:
If you see a link you would like to save for your PR, click the Site-ation icon once to add the link to your list of Site-ations.
Once you are on your github PR page, double-click the icon to copy all your Site-ations onto your clipboard. Site-ations will be autoformatted to allow for easy pasting. 

_Note: All currently stored Site-ations are deleted once you copy them to the clipboard_

After listing your Site-ations in your PR description, the site-ations will be added **_once you merge your PR_**.
