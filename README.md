# siteation
Site-ation is a Browser Extension and GitHub Action that uses DynamoDB to log when a site(be it a Blog Post, Stack Overflow Thread, or online guide) helped someone solve a problem in their PR!

Site-ation aims to access as little information from your Org/Repo as possible. No information or contents about your Identity, PR, Account, or Org are accessed or stored except for any URLs that are located under a "[Site-ations]" list in your initial PR's Issue Description section.
